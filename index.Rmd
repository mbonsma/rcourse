title: "Syllabus: EEB430H1 Theoretical Ecology and Reproducible Quantitative Methods in R [24L, 12P]"
---

This course focuses on theoretical ecology concepts and reproducible quantitative methods in R. Theoretical ecology uses models to explain biological phenomena such as the maintenance of biodiversity, population growth, competition, eco-evolutionary dynamics, epidemiology, spatial ecology, and species extinction. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, analytically thorough, and well documented science. Students will learn to develop ecological population models, analyze data, and document their research using the R programming language. No prerequisite programming experience is required.

Prerequisites: MAT 136, BIO220H1, EEB225H1, and two of EEB319H1, EEB321H1,
EEB322H1, EEB323H1

Lecture halls are usually open 9 am - 5 pm, see the [online schedules](http://lab.chass.utoronto.ca/carr.php) for available times.

## Contact info
Blackboard is the preferred communication channel. If you need to use email instead, please address all general course-related issues to joel.ostblom@mail.utoronto.ca, and project specific communication to the respective TA of your group. Prefix the subject matter with "EEB430". If you do not receive a reply within 48 hours (excluding week-ends), please send a reminder.

## Course learning outcomes
1. Integrate and apply concepts and theoretical models learnt in class.
2. Learn how to use basic statistics to analyze and interpret data.
3. Use R to apply theoretical models and perform data analysis.
4. Realize that data do not always fit theoretical models, but that it is important to interpret data with a larger theoretical framework in mind.
5. Learn how to work as part of a research team to produce a scientific product.
6. Learn what is required to generate a scientific item ready for publishing.

## Improving your writing skills
Effective communication is crucial in science. The [University of Toronto provides services](http://writing.utoronto.ca/) to help you improve your writing, from general advices on effective writing to writing centers and writing courses. The Faculty of Arts & Science also offers an English Language Learning (ELL) program, which provides free individualized instruction in English skills. Take advantage of these!

## Academic integrity
You should be aware of the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. Also see [How Not to Plagiarize](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/). Note that it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources â€“ there is no review of most online material and there are many errors out there. Use only academic or government internet sources when absolutely necessary. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor. Please make sure that what you submit for the final project does not overlap with what you submit for other classes, such as the 4th year research project. We will not enforce this, but the department will.

There are 100 marks in total. Your final course mark will be the sum of your assignment scores, which will be translated to a letter grade according to the [official grading scale](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/teacher-info/academic-handbook-for-instructors/sections-9-11#official) of the Faculty of Arts and Science.

Students can be absent from two lectures (*including* project work days) without losing any participation marks. After that, students will lose 1 mark per missed lecture.

Assignments will be distributed and submitted in the R Markdown format via Blackboard or GitHub. Assignments will be handed out on Thursdays and are due 11:59 pm on the Tuesday eight weekdays later. _There will be a penalty of 5% per day (including week-ends) for late submissions._

| Contribution to group work and self-assessment | Student contributed little to project; self-assessed contributions are low in quality and/or quantity; self-assessment is not consistent with actual contribution.                                            | Student contributed adequately to project; made some significant contributions                                                                                    | Student substantially contributed to project to ensure success; self-assessed contributions are crucial to project; self-assessment is consistent with actual contribution.            |

| Style and reproducibility                      | Code and writing are poorly organized, poorly formatted, missing units, difficult to read, poorly documented, difficult to reproduce analyses                                                                 | Code and writing are well-organized, well-formatted, consistent use of units and significant figures                                                              | Code and writing are precise and clear throughout, free of errors, well-organized, well-documented, easily reproducible analyses, publication-ready                                    |

As the final project is a team effort, all members within a group will receive the same mark. A final project that is considered to lie between two of the defined levels will be marked accordingly, e.g. between "Adequate" and "Excellent" would be 5, 6, or 7 marks.
